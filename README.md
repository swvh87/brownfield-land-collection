# brownfield land collection

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)](https://github.com/digital-land/brownfield-land/blob/master/LICENSE)

A collection of individual [brownfield land registers](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/brownfield-land-registers) collected each night from local planning authorities, which are processed and then assembled into a national dataset.

The national dataset is in a format consistent with other Digital Land datasets as defined by the [brownfield-land schema](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/schema/brownfield-land/).

* [brownfield land registers](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/brownfield-land-registers) — GOV.UK guidance for local planning authorities on brownfield land to be included in their register.
* [publish your brownfield land data](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/brownfield-land-registers-data-standard/publish-your-brownfield-land-data) — guidance for local planning authorities on the data format when publishing brownfield land data.

# Updating the collection

We recommend working in [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) before installing the python [requirements](requirements.txt), [makerules](https://github.com/digital-land/makerules) and other dependencies:

    $ make update
    $ make init
    $ make collect

Collected files can be converted into a national dataset:

    $ make
