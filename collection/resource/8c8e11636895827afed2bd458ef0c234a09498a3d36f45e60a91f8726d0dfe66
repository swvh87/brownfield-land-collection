Additional open space on the northern part of the cutting will be encouraged to mitigate any local loss and provide new open space, if funding can be secured. Development proposals should be sensitive to the historic context and seek to preserve and enhance the setting of heritage assets through sensitive design and scale.","New commercial uses should be provided at ground floor and potentially upper levels fronting onto Hampstead Road, to reinforce the role and function of this street. This space could provide approximately 230 new jobs.A new 2FE primary school should be provided as a minimum to support new housing here and above and around the station. Potentially a further 1-2 FE of school provision, depending on the number of homes proposed, will be required to meet estimated school place demands in the area. Therefore contributions from development here combined with contributions from development around Euston Station, could support the funding of additional school facilities in the Regent’s Park Estate if required. This is to ensure the combined needs of the potential new population are met within or close to the plan area.
