Brownfield land, aslo known as previously developed land is defined as land which is or was occupied by a permanent structure, including the curtilage of the
developed land (although it should not be assumed that the whole of the curtilage should be developed) and any associated fixed surface infrastructure. This
excludes: land that is or was last occupied by agricultural or forestry buildings; land that has been developed for minerals extraction or waste disposal by landfill,
where provision for restoration has been made through development management procedures; land in built-up areas such as residential gardens, parks, recreation
grounds and allotments; and land that was previously developed but where the remains of the permanent structure or fixed surface structure have blended into the
landscape.
