Residential development should not be provided on the ground floor due to flood risk but general living accommodation could be acceptable, subject to the FRA. The site is next to an SSSI. Development should not adversely affect the dunes.

"Land at Northeye (Former UAE Technical Training Project), Bexhill",,,2018-10-01,,6.36,140,140,"This brownfield site is part of a larger site that includes greenfield land. The site is proposed to be allocated in the DaSA - proposed submission October 2018 - for some 140 dwellings, of which 30% should be provided as affordable housing. A full size adult football pitch and/or a senior cricket pitch should be provided on the northern part of the site, alongside associated ancillary changing and parking facilities to serve the playing pitch. Highway access should be provided from Wartling Drive and Principal Close, via Coneyburrow Lane, alongside offsite highway works to make the development acceptable in highway terms. In accordance with policy DEN5 ‘Sustainable Drainage’ at least two forms of appropriate SuDS should be incorporated and an Appropriate Assessment under the Habitat Regulations demonstrates beyond reasonable scientific doubt that these can be delivered on the site and that the development can otherwise proceed, with mitigation if necessary, without harming the integrity of the adjacent Pevensey Levels Special Area of Conservation/Ramsar site. Flood zone 3 should be kept free from development.Suitable provision should be made for children’s play space in the form of both a Locally Equipped Area for Play (LEAP) and a Local Area for Play (LAP). The Public Right of Way (PROW) should be reinstated through the middle of the site, following the stream corridor together with a financial contribution towards improvements to the existing PROW network in the locality. Improvements should be made to existing local bus stop infrastructure and a financial contribution towards improving local bus services. Provision should be made for the retention and enhancement of existing landscape buffers with locally characteristic native tree and shrub planting, particularly on the western and northern boundaries. A connection should be provided to the local sewerage system at the nearest point of adequate capacity, in collaboration with the service provider. Development of the site should be through a Green Infrastructure framework and landscape led masterplan.
