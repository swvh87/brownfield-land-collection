Retain and integrate the historic building sensitively into the site. Retain or re-provide existing office floorspace as part of a mixed use scheme. Homes should front streets and some green spaces to provide sociable and safe neighbourhoods. The possibility of homes facing outwards onto Knights Croft and the footpath that runs along the west of the site should be explored to integrate the site into the neighbourhoods on either side and improve the quality of the environment along these routes. Establish a network of connected streets which prioritise walking and cycling over private car use for short trips within the development. Proposals should especially consider safe and clear pedestrian and cycle routes to New Ash Green village centre. This might require improvement to the existing route that connects the shops with North Ash Road via Over Minnis. Principal vehicle access to the site will be from North Ash Road. Use the natural features of the site to inform development and integrate it into its wider setting. The trees can be used to reinforce local distinctiveness.
