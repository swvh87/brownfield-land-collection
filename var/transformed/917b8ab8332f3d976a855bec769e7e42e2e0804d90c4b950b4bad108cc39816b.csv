The Council has allocated it as a mixed use site in the Gosport Borough Local Plan 2029 which could include some residential. However given its enormous potential for marine employment due to its deep water access and features suited to the marine sector as well as its significant heritage assets, the Council has not yet determined a potential housing figure for this site at this stage. Further consideration is required including taking into account the significant flood risk on the site, the proximity to internationally protected habitats and understanding the full extent of the MoD release and which users are intending to remain on site.",local-authority-eng:GOS,not owned by a public authority,,,not permissioned,,BR27,http://maps.gosport.gov.uk/eggp/?webroot=default&dept=Planning&scriptname=Brownfield%20Land%20Register&cpx=462260.777&cpy=99070.084&scale=5000&redraw=cp,2017-12-15
