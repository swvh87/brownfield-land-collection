The possibility of homes facing outwards onto Knights Croft and the footpath that runs along the west of the site should be explored to integrate the site into the neighbourhoods on either side and improve the quality of the environment along these routes. Establish a network of connected streets which prioritise walking and cycling over private car use for short trips within the development. Proposals should especially consider safe and clear pedestrian and cycle routes to New Ash Green village centre. This might require improvement to the existing route that connects the shops with North Ash Road via Over Minnis. Principal vehicle access to the site will be from North Ash Road.

The Howard Venue is a valued asset well used by the local community and should be retained on the site. The strong orthogonal character of the existing site should inform the development of future development structure through a simple gridded block structure. The historic avenue of trees along the western boundary of the site provides an opportunity to create well defined built frontage facing onto landscape rather than the backs of buildings. Be fully integrated into the existing urban fabric by responding to the village character of Hextable in terms of scale, materials and layout. Use the existing perimeter block street pattern to the east of the site on Egerton Avenue and New Road to inform the layout of housing on site. Establish a network of connected streets which prioritise walking and cycling over private car use for short trips within the development. The structure of the site should naturally extend the existing grain of streets. The development of the site provides a good opportunity to introduce a new pedestrian link from the elbow of Egerton Avenue towards the south and west to connect into the top of Swanley Park. Create safe, attractive and clear cycling and pedestrian routes which minimise distances between the site and local shops, services and public transport interchanges. Ensure a hierarchy of routes so that important routes are clearly identifiable. Use the natural features of the site to inform development and integrate it into its wider setting.
